# SurgeXT for VCV Rack

This repository builds SurgeXT Rack extensions, our reboot of the old Surge 1.7 Rack modules
with more features, better design, and lots of other exciting stuff, which is a work in progress.

If you are looking for the source of the Surge modules in the VCV Rack library please check the `release/2.1.7.0`
branch.

These modules are still incomplete. We are planning an official launch but have decided to develop
them in the open. But as such we ask a few things

If you use these modules please note that, before our official release, we may at any time make breaking changes, rename
or change modules, and so on. These should not be considered stable. But they are starting to work reasonably well and
our checklist is getting shorter.

If you package modules into various forks of VCV Rack, you are welcome to do a test build, but please
do not release these modules into a distribution of a fork until we have our official 1.0 release. (Of course
the GPL3 license would allow you to ignore this request, but please don't).

if you want to know when the release happens.

If you want to help with the code please hit us up in the #surge-rack channel in our discord.

Still interested? Well we have a binary [Here](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge-rack/releases/tag/Nightly)
which we update on every commit, so it is the latest greatest. And you can build the standard way:

Checkout sources:
```
git clone https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge-rack
cd surge-rack
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Build with Make:
```
export RACK_DIR=location-of-rack-SDK-or-source
make dist
```
Build directly with CMake:
```
mkdir surge-rack-build
cd surge-rack-build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=dist -DRACK_SDK_DIR=location-of-rack-SDK-or-source ../surge-rack
make install
```
To compile the plugin with CMake for Mac OSX `x86_64` platform append `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="x86_64"` to the cmake
command, to compile for `arm64` platform use `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="arm64"`.
